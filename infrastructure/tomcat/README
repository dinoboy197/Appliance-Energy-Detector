These files are provided for local development.

Here is how I would strongly recommend that you use these files:	

1) If you do not already have a Tomcat 6 installation locally with separate Tomcat home and Tomcat base directories, download Tomcat 6.
2) Add the snippet in the context-snippet.xml into your local tomcat context.xml file, then customize it.
3) Add the snippet in the server-snippet.xml into your local tomcat server.xml file, then customize it.
4) Download and install junixsocket into your Tomcat home, so that the directory structure <tomcathome>/junixsocket-1.3/lib-native exists.
5) Add the junixsocket-x.jar and junixsocket-mysql-x.jar into your <tomcathome>/lib directory.
6) Add the mysql-x.jar into your <tomcathome>/lib directory.
7) Place the start.sh and stop.sh scripts into your Tomcat base, and customize them.
8) Run "ant update-deps" in the Appliance Energy Labeler and Evaluation Tool projects.
9) Import the trunk energy labeler and evaluation engine project into Eclipse, and ensure that Build Automatically is set.
10) Ensure that the code builds locally in Eclipse WITHOUT errors.
11) Load the database script from the <Appliance Detection Engine Project>/src/db/db.sql into your MySQL database for your project.
12) Run the start.sh script.
